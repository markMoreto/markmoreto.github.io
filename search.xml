        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past decade, government across the world find ways to battle the piracy by sharing through p2p or torrent. Many of the top torrent sites has down including some big file sharing sites. </p><p>Seeders and Leechers are trying to find ways to protect themselves from the government by doing tons of security measurements such as using TOR, VPN (proven zero logs), using non-personal pc and many more.</p><p>However, lately, while searching for active torrent sites in 2018, I noticed an ad that captures my attention. A cloud-based torrenting site that downloads and seeds the torrent for you at the same time. This site promises that will do the security layer for you and promise not to sell your data while using their services to download a torrent or legit files. This sites has been running for sometime now and found out that has tons of users across the globe.</p><p>Here, I will share my experiences on the top cloud-based torrents and give them honest feedback.</p><h2 id="Seedr-cc"><a href="#Seedr-cc" class="headerlink" title="Seedr.cc"></a>Seedr.cc</h2><p>I been seeing Seedr.cc before in many tweets from colleagues but never tried to check or visit their website before. Seedr.cc same as others is a cloud-based torrent and downloading site. Although currently as of writing, they do not have the actual list of their features on one page, here the pros and cons based on my experience.</p><h3 id="Seedr-Pros"><a href="#Seedr-Pros" class="headerlink" title="Seedr Pros:"></a>Seedr Pros:</h3><ul><li>Insanely Blazing Fast Download - instantly download the files for you in seconds (tried 100gb file and instant, its available for me in seconds). The magic here is once the data has been downloaded before by other users, this file will be shared with you. But tried weird and poor seeders but still, I downloaded a 26GB file less than an hour. Not so bad after all.</li><li>Security - As promised, all the data being download are being scanned by Kaspersky</li><li>Streaming - When you download a movie, they will try to play the video for you; a regular standard video for non-paid users while HD setting for premium users. </li><li>Servers - premium users can choose their server or just set to fastest server available.</li><li>Free Users - generously grants instant 2gb space for free users and can add up to 2.5gb in a total of 4.5gb through series of posts and reviews via Twitter, Youtube, Pinterest and blog post.</li><li>Static IP - private trackers can have assigned static IP feature</li><li>FTP and WebDAV - aside from native download through their website, premium users (depending on the subscription) can enjoy this benefits.</li><li>REST API - for high-end subscribers, a REST API feature is being offered. Not sure what’s the purpose but somehow, it opens some doors to extend the functionality.</li><li>Browser Add-ons - I found Seedr.cc provides browser add-ons to Chrome and Firefox for easy downloading.</li><li>Unlimited Bandwidth - currently their offer unlimited bandwidth which means despite your torrent and downloading activity, you can do whatever as much as you want.</li></ul><h3 id="Seedr-Cons"><a href="#Seedr-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Seedr Cons"></a>Seedr Cons</h3><ul><li>Limited Servers - although you can select around more than ten servers in different locations, I find some of it is very slow when downloading the file.<br>Tried with VPN and still find it slow.</li><li>Zero Plugins - unfortunately, I found out that unlike other cloud-based torrent sites, Seedr.cc does not offer extensibility to send your files from their website directly to cloud-based storage such as Dropbox, Google Drive or Microsoft Drive.</li><li>Customer Support - I subscribe to 100gb as Pro user, and I find the Customer Support response time is not that great. I experience waiting for 24 hours, although not that bad but hoping to get an answer quickly as much as possible.</li><li>Limited Torrents - honestly I don’t mind it but for some, this might be an issue. Depending on your subscription, Seedr limits the parallel download at the same time.</li></ul><h2 id="Bitport-io"><a href="#Bitport-io" class="headerlink" title="Bitport.io"></a>Bitport.io</h2><p>This site is my next personal choice. Aside from nice UI and a wide range of plugins, integration and tips support. I tried them for a few and here are the following pros and cons I experience.</p><h3 id="Bitport-Pros"><a href="#Bitport-Pros" class="headerlink" title="Bitport Pros"></a>Bitport Pros</h3><ul><li>Wide Integration and Plugins - bitport offers lots of integration and plugins, whether you want to send your file directly to Google Drive,  Samsung TV, Apple TV and many more.</li><li>Streaming - like its competitors, Bitport allows you to watch movies online.</li><li>Security - all files are being scanned by ESET NOD 32.</li><li>RSS - enjoy downloading files through RSS downloader</li><li>Torrents per day - Unlimited Torrents per day. Its one of the freest features.</li><li>Bitcoin - in case you want to pay using your bitcoin, Bitport allows you to do that.</li><li>Nice UI - I like so much the user experience. It’s not confusing at all and just straightforward.</li></ul><h3 id="Bitport-Cons"><a href="#Bitport-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Bitport Cons"></a>Bitport Cons</h3><ul><li>Slow Download - somehow, I find Bitport slower to download the files. I tried to download a 1gb file, and it took me 2-3 hours.</li><li>Video Support - I tried to download a .mkv file, and I wasn’t able to play the video.</li><li>No Static IP - although it’s not part of my requirements, I find using a static IP feature useful</li><li>A little Expensive - unlike others, $15 will give you 250GB space. </li></ul><h2 id="OffCloud-com"><a href="#OffCloud-com" class="headerlink" title="OffCloud.com"></a>OffCloud.com</h2><p>OffCloud does a lot of things aside from torrent downloading. It offers you tons of extensive features and extensibility from downloading torrents, youtube videos, adult videos, books, rapidgator files, online articles, or downloading from Usenet.</p><p>However, due to a large number of features, I did not have a chance to test them all plus having limited access to free membership. But here’s what I observe:</p><ul><li>Proxy servers across the globe </li><li>Remote Cloud Storage</li><li>Cloud Backup</li><li>Fair decent download speed</li><li>A little confusing UI for your download files</li><li>Limited usage and feature for free members</li></ul>]]></content>

      <title>Intermittent Fasting and Keto Diet</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most buzz diet around the globe now is the so-called “Keto Diet” which means fewer carbs and more fats, more protein, combining with non-stashy and greeny leaf vegetables. Thousands of people claim across nations that this diet is very effective. But for some, to make it more effective, many believe this should match with Intermittent Fasting or “IF”.</p><h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><p>Not so long ago, before Keto and Paleo diet becomes part of my dictionary, I been reading a research blog post from Bee Wilder. Her blog is the product of her 30 years research started way back 1985 when she got ill and looking for medicines. I discovered her website way back to 2011 when my father was looking for a natural way to heal himself due to massive fallback of being a cigarette smoker.</p><p>Bee Wilder’s website “Healing Naturally By Bee”, is an informative website that contains information about getting your health back by using the natural way thus by saying “Let the food be your medicine”. Since then, I learned a lot from what food does harm to you, and what food are good for you. She also describes the false theory of cholesterol and the best enemy of us, Sugar. Currently, there are many success stories can be found on her website and the Yahoo Group.</p><p>Bee Wilder’s profile can be found <a href="https://www.healingnaturallybybee.com/about-bee-wilder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p><p>While here are list of precious articles:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.healingnaturallybybee.com/foods-that-damage-foods-that-heal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food that Damage, Food that heal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healingnaturallybybee.com/lose-weight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lose Weight</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healingnaturallybybee.com/healthy-diet-foods-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthy Food List</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healingnaturallybybee.com/why-probiotics-are-not-needed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Probiotics not needed</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healingnaturallybybee.com/deep-breathing-exercises-help-you-heal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Breathing</a></li></ul><h2 id="The-Trial"><a href="#The-Trial" class="headerlink" title="The Trial"></a>The Trial</h2><p>After some time, when a co-worker was dealing with Keto and IF, he was able to encourage me to try the two combination technique for getting lose weight. Since the approach is very identical to my understanding of healthy food, he was able to convince me to give it try.</p><p>For the past 2 weeks, I’m doing an Intermittent Fasting given with 16 hrs. of fasting with no food at all and just water while 6 hrs. of window eating every day. During window eating time, I intake food 2-3 times based on a Keto diet approach. Which means no rice at all, fewer carbs as much as possible, and more fats and green veggies.</p><p>The first 3 days were very challenging, tough and hard to resist. Cutting out the regular habit was the first thing to beat. For a guy like me that likes to eat a large amount of food, combining with juice or ice tea, that makes a lot of challenges.</p><p>During the first week, the next battle is coping with stress. As you can imagine, I’m doing with a Keto diet and “IF” while working at night. This battle is kinda crazy and hard to win. Luckily for me, I was able to compose some tricks which are I’m doing my window eating time during my work at night, while the fasting is working while I sleep.</p><p>The days go by and I am able to manage. I was able to control my bowel movement and my cravings. I feel I’m getting thinner in and out and having this light feeling making my shirts fit well and relaxed. Then I started cooking more food with olive oils, coconut oil (MCT), and more natural fat from meat.</p><p>Everything goes well until…</p><h2 id="Worst-Decision"><a href="#Worst-Decision" class="headerlink" title="Worst Decision"></a>Worst Decision</h2><p>Well after doing the Keto diet and “IF” for the last two weeks, a friend of mine called me telling me that they are going to celebrate something and course of, that will deal with tons foods and drinks. </p><p>During that time, to my mind, I’m thinking about “Cheat Day”. From my perspective before, a diet should have a cheat day, that you can at least eat the food you want and drink alcohol because you know, you are not doing it for quite some time now and maybe a cheat day just for once after two weeks would not be bad at all.</p><p>So the day comes, I drank tons of beers, ate a lot of food mixing from meats, fruits, sweets plus I also drink coke. Well, it turns out, around 5 pm in the afternoon, I am started to realize, that’s the worst decision I ever made.</p><p>The “party” started around 10 am and after 5 pm during that day, I am beginning to feel so much stomach pain. The pain is somehow unimaginable that I never felt before in my entire life. It aches so much that I am having a hard time to breathe, walk or stand.</p><p>After an hour, the pain goes to my lower back. It’s crazy that my stomach and lower back aches the same time which prevents me from laying from a bed or leaning my back on a chair. During that moment, I know myself, this is not a regular pain, this is not something that you can fix using the over the counter medicine and this is a thing that needs a help from a Doctor.</p><h2 id="Aftermath"><a href="#Aftermath" class="headerlink" title="Aftermath"></a>Aftermath</h2><p>I ended up in the hospital and was confined for the entire week or exactly as 7 days. It turns out the doctors found a twisted small intestine or they called small bowel volvulus due to small bowel obstruction.</p><p>When I heard this terms, I already thought I was going to under operation. I was already introduced to a surgeon doctor and everything syncing in after that.</p><p>The doctors asking me to take NGT or Nasogastric intubation to release the fluids and gas in my stomach. All of these things making a lot of emotional stress as for me that never been hospitalized.</p><p>Luckily, my best friend came over with her nurse girlfriend. They explain to me all this stuff that I really don’t understand. After a while, when the pain reliever effect no longer works and the pain is coming back, I was encouraged and brave to put that NGT on my nose going to my stomach.</p><p>Overnight, it releases all of the fluids and gas from my stomach. The first morning, I was able to poop 3 times in the morning. That’s somehow I got relief and no longer feel the pain. I do not feel bloated or anything. And that leads my twisted small intestine to collapse, putting it back in the normal state through series of X-Rays and CT-Scans.</p><h2 id="Analysis"><a href="#Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Analysis"></a>Analysis</h2><p>The crazy things that happened to me are the very rare case due to most of the time, people that getting that twisted small intestine are only for those people who had past surgical operation. So it may be the amount of the alcohol or the amount of food or both.</p><p>But during my last day in the hospital, I tried to research and google my case. I was unconvinced that it was just the alcohol or the food. So while scrolling to the search results, I found an article about a 45-year-old woman who died in the same case as mine. But unlike her, after ultrasound and X-ray, the doctors did not find anything. When she comes home, she died and after the autopsy, they found she died to due blockage of blood in her stomach.</p><p>On that page, the author pointed out that the same case happens to people mostly to Asians after they had Ramadan or series or fasting then ate high fiber food. It seems to me that’s where I can relate. I have been doing intensive fasting and diet then suddenly I thought cheat day would not be bad at all.</p><p>It turns, that is causing our small intestine to twist, which I’d like to think it might due to the amount of food intake after fasting. </p>]]></content>
